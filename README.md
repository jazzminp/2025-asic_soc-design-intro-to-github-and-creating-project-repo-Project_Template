## Project Title:
AudioAccel

## Project Description:
Our goal is to design a custom ASIC that can accelerate FFT operations, offering a more optimized, energy-efficient, and faster alternative for analyzing audio signals in real-time applications such as sound analysis, noise reduction, or audio filtering.The problem we are addressing is the inefficiency and high power consumption of general-purpose processors and FPGAs in performing real-time audio signal processing tasks, specifically the Fast Fourier Transform (FFT). 

## Key Objectives:
Objective 1: Design and implement an efficient FFT algorithm in Verilog/VHDL tailored for audio signal processing.
Objective 2: Synthesize, verify, and optimize the ASIC design using industry-standard EDA tools such as DC Shell, FM Shell, and ICC2 Shell.
Objective 3: Demonstrate real-time FFT processing on audio signals using simulation and visualization through DVE, ensuring both functional accuracy and performance targets are met.

## Technology Stack:
Hardware Platform: Microphone
Software Tools:
-	Synopsys Design Compiler (DC Shell) – for RTL synthesis
-Formal Verification (FM Shell) – for logic equivalence checking
-	IC Compiler II (ICC2 Shell) – for place-and-route and physical design
-	Verdi/DVE – for simulation and waveform analysis
Programming Languages:
-	Verilog or VHDL for RTL design
-	TCL scripts for EDA automation
- Python for	Audio waveform generation and conversion tools pre and post processing 

## Expected Outcomes:
-	A fully synthesized and verified FFT-based ASIC design capable of real-time audio signal processing.
-	Optimized performance in terms of speed, power, and area usage.
-	Functional simulation and verification results displayed via DVE.
-	Documentation and analysis of FFT performance improvements compared to general-purpose solutions.
